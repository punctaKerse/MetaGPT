# How to Create a Multi-Vendor Marketplace with Prestashop
 
If you want to run an online store that sells products from multiple vendors, you need a multi-vendor marketplace platform. A multi-vendor marketplace allows you to host multiple sellers on your site, each with their own products, prices, inventory, and policies. You can earn commissions from each sale, while providing your customers with a wide range of products and services.
 
One of the most popular and powerful platforms for creating a multi-vendor marketplace is Prestashop. Prestashop is an open-source e-commerce solution that offers a lot of features and flexibility for both store owners and vendors. However, Prestashop does not have a built-in multi-vendor functionality by default. You need to install a third-party module to enable it.
