In this article, we will show you how to use WinWedge Pro 3.1.141 to collect data from serial devices in three easy steps:
 
1. Select your device's parameters.
2. Define the data structure.
3. Select the mode and activate.

## Step 1: Select your device's parameters
 
The first step is to connect your device to your PC's serial or USB port and install any necessary drivers. Then, launch WinWedge Pro 3.1.141 and use the interface to select your device's communications settings, such as the COM port, baud rate, parity, data bits, and stop bits.
 
You can also choose from a list of predefined device configurations or create your own custom configuration. WinWedge Pro 3.1.141 supports a wide range of devices and protocols, including RS232, RS485, some USB, TCP/IP, or disk file data.
 
## Step 2: Define the data structure
 
The next step is to define how you want to parse, filter, and format the data that you receive from your device. WinWedge Pro 3.1.141 has powerful data parsing capabilities that allow you to split the record into multiple fields, remove unwanted characters, convert data types, perform calculations, and more.
 
You can also define hot keys and buttons to send serial commands to your device or perform other tasks. For example, you can send a command to zero a scale or request a measurement from a meter. You can also use WinWedge Pro 3.1.141 to control other Windows applications or web pages by sending keystrokes or DDE commands.
 
## Step 3: Select the mode and activate
 
The final step is to select how you want to transfer the data from WinWedge Pro 3.1.141 to your target application or file. You can choose from three modes:

- Keystrokes Mode: This mode simulates keyboard input and sends the data as keystrokes to the active window.
- DDE Server Mode: This mode uses Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to send the data as DDE messages to any DDE-compatible application.
- Log to Disk: This mode saves the data to a disk file in CSV or TXT format.

After selecting the mode, you can specify the target application or file name and activate WinWedge Pro 3.1.141. You will see the data from your device "pop" into your target application or web page.
 
## Conclusion
 
WinWedge Pro 3.1.141 is a versatile software that enables you to collect data from any serial device and input it into any Windows application or web page. It also allows you to control your device by sending serial commands through the serial port.
